# phonetics-modeling

The purpose of this project is to model phonetics and phonology in a programming
language according to Linguistics. The source for our information
will be Linguistics textbooks,
and the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Currently, I am using only the textbook with ISBN: 978-1-4051-9103, The
second chapter. It is titled The Sounds of Language.




Currently the program only determines the place, and manner of articulation,
for a handful of consonants (typed in IPA (unicode format)).

The project is split into parts written in different programming languages. Each part may have different features and functionality than another. Open the readme file inside a subdirectory (such as 'haskell') to get specific information on each subproject.

Suggested future uses once complete:
Basic Linguistic tasks:
  - determining if a sound has a minimal pair given a list of text.
  - determining if a feature is marked or unmarked in an inventory of sounds
  - converting between IPA and a feature based representation

It is under a permissive license.
Feel free to use it for educational purposes.

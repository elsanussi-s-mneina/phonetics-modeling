# phonetics-modeling

The purpose of this project is to model phonetics and phonology in a programming
language according to Linguistics. The source for our information
will be Linguistics textbooks,
and the International Phonetic Alphabet.

I am using the textbook with ISBN: 978-1-4051-9103, The
second chapter. The textbook is titled The Sounds of Language.

To see a demonstration of the program, without having to install it, please [see the screenshots](https://github.com/elsanussi-s-mneina/phonetics-modeling/wiki/screenshots).

The program is in an early stage of development, and many aspects will likely change.

Currently the program determines the place, and manner of articulation,
for a handful of consonants (typed in IPA (unicode format)).
It also gives the SPE features for many phonemes.
It also splits (chunks) IPA into phonemes.
It also gives English descriptions of a phoneme when given the phoneme represented in IPA.




It is under a permissive license.
Feel free to use it for educational purposes.
